## Dolphin Emulator Install

Our first step in this set-up is installing the dolphin emulator. Dolphin is an open-source emulator for the Nintendo GameCube and Wii. It will be our way of playing MarioKart Wii (MK) on our PC.

1. First step is download Dolphin at [Downloads](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/) and click the Windows x64.

2. The next download is the MK ROM, which stands for Read-Only Memory but is more for hardware devices to prevent Remote Code Execution. Now distributing ROMs are not allowed so you will have to find your own way to download it. But you can look for the `help.txt` file. (Note: It should be about a 2.6 GB download)

3. Extract the folder and open the file called `Dolphin` or `Dolphin.exe`

4. When you open the Dolphin emu, you should see this screen. Click   `PLAY` and open the MK Rom it may look something like `Mario Kart Wii (USA) (EnFrEs).rvz`.

From there Dolphin should start up MK like normal!
